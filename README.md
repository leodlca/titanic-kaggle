# titanic-kaggle
My attempts to solve and rank up at the introductory machine learning problem "Titanic" at Kaggle.

### TODO
- Use GridSearch to optimize models.
- Consider trying more algorithms.
- Use matplotlib to visualize the data in a better way.
- Use markdown instead of code comments, and do it better.
- Rank up.
